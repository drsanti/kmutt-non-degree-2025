# Deployment and Git Workflow Rules

## Deployment Process
Follow the established deployment workflow using [deploy.sh](mdc:deploy.sh):

### Git Workflow
- Use the provided `deploy.sh` script for consistent deployments
- Default commit message: "add slides" (customizable)
- Always check git status before committing
- Push to remote repository after successful commit

### Deployment Script Usage
```bash
# Standard deployment
./deploy.sh

# Custom commit message
./deploy.sh "update course content"
```

### GitHub Pages Integration
- Repository is configured for GitHub Pages deployment
- Main entry point: [index.html](mdc:index.html)
- Course materials are served from the repository root
- Live site: https://drsanti.github.io/kmutt-non-degree-2025/

### File Management
- Keep deployment documentation in [DEPLOY.md](mdc:DEPLOY.md)
- Maintain consistent file structure for proper serving
- Ensure all relative links work correctly after deployment

### Pre-deployment Checks
- Verify all course links are functional
- Test responsive design on multiple devices
- Check that Gamma presentations load correctly
- Validate HTML and CSS syntax

### Version Control Best Practices
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Commit related changes together
- Test locally before pushing to remote
- Keep the repository clean and organized

## Troubleshooting
- Check git status for uncommitted changes
- Verify remote repository configuration
- Ensure proper file permissions for scripts
- Test deployment in a clean environment
