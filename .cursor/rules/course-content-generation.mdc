# Course Content Generation Rules

## Content Structure Standards
When creating or editing course content, follow these patterns:

### Module Documentation
- Use English for all technical content and documentation
- Follow the structure defined in existing [rules.md](mdc:nd2025/nd01/m01/docs/rules.md) files
- Include learning objectives, prerequisites, and hands-on exercises
- Maintain progressive difficulty across modules

### File Naming Conventions
- Course rules: `rules.md` in module directories
- Layout content: `layout.md` or `layout-d01.md`, `layout-d02.md` for daily content
- Use descriptive names that indicate content type and day

### Content Quality Standards
- **Technical Accuracy**: Ensure all technical content is current and accurate
- **Practical Focus**: Emphasize hands-on, project-based learning
- **Industry Relevance**: Align content with industrial automation systems
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide step-by-step guidance for exercises

### Course-Specific Guidelines
- **ND01**: Focus on electronic circuit design, Proteus simulation, and IoT development
- **ND02**: Emphasize web development, TypeScript, databases, and CI/CD
- **ND03**: Cover 3D modeling, Digital Twins, OPC-UA, and industrial systems

### Documentation Format
- Use Markdown format with clear headings
- Include code examples with inline comments
- Provide complete, runnable examples
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout
