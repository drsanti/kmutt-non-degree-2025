### **Topic 1: Introduction to Edge Computing**

**Purpose:**
To understand how computational workloads are distributed between embedded devices (edge nodes) and central computer systems (cloud/servers) in modern automation.

**Key Concepts:**

* Edge computing brings data processing closer to the devices generating data.
* Reduces latency and bandwidth usage, improving responsiveness.
* Essential for **Industrial IoT**, **smart factories**, and **autonomous systems**.

**Subtopics:**

1. **Edge vs Cloud Architecture**

   * **Cloud**: Centralized processing, high scalability.
   * **Edge**: Local processing, fast decision-making.
   * Example: PLC analyzes sensor data locally to trigger alarms before sending summary data to the cloud.

2. **Benefits of Edge Computing**

   * Low latency for real-time control.
   * Enhanced privacy (data stays local).
   * Reduced network congestion.

3. **Edge Hardware Examples**

   * Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, Intel NUC, Siemens IOT2040.
   * Embedded systems with Linux or RTOS supporting real-time data analytics.

4. **Use Case**

   * A robotic cell uses an edge controller to detect abnormal torque in motors.
   * Only alerts and trends are transmitted to the central monitoring server.

### **Topic 2: Intelligent Automation with AI and Machine Learning**

**Purpose:**
To leverage artificial intelligence at the edge for predictive, adaptive, and autonomous industrial processes.

**Key Concepts:**

* Embedded devices now have sufficient processing power for **AI inference**.
* Machine learning enables pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and optimization.
* Combining AI with automation enhances **efficiency** and **reliability**.

**Subtopics:**

1. **AI at the Edge**

   * ML models run locally on microcontrollers or gateways.
   * Example: TensorFlow Lite model detects faulty vibration signatures directly in the embedded controller.

2. **Predictive Maintenance**

   * AI analyzes vibration, temperature, or current patterns to forecast failures.
   * Example: An edge-based ML model predicts motor bearing failure 24 hours before it occurs.

3. **Adaptive Process Control**

   * Control parameters adjust automatically based on sensor feedback and learned patterns.
   * Example: Chemical dosing system adjusts valve timing based on previous process data trends.

4. **Practical Implementation**

   * Train model in cloud ‚Üí deploy inference model to edge gateway.
   * Example: Edge device performs real-time detection; cloud updates model periodically.

### **Topic 3: Edge-to-Cloud Integration**

**Purpose:**
To coordinate local decision-making at the edge with global oversight and analytics in the cloud.

**Key Concepts:**

* Cooperation between **local embedded control** and **centralized management systems**.
* Uses secure communication protocols and data pipelines.
* Common tools: MQTT, OPC UA over AMQP, REST APIs.

**Subtopics:**

1. **Hybrid Architecture Design**

   * Divide functions: edge handles control logic, cloud handles reporting.
   * Example: Edge controller runs PID loop; cloud performs long-term energy optimization.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Filtering**

   * Edge nodes aggregate and clean raw sensor data.
   * Example: Edge device transmits only average temperature and anomalies instead of raw 1,000 Hz data.

3. **Secure Data Transfer**

   * Use TLS-encrypted MQTT or HTTPS for safe upstream communication.
   * Example: Edge gateway uploads production KPIs to Azure IoT Hub securely.

4. **Example Implementation**

   * Edge gateway ‚Üí MQTT Broker ‚Üí Cloud dashboard.
   * Real-time visualization of equipment performance and health indicators.

### **Topic 4: Containerization and Edge Deployment**

**Purpose:**
To simplify deployment, scaling, and updating of automation software on distributed edge devices.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Containers (Docker, Podman)** allow portable and reproducible environments.
* Enable **continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)** for automation systems.

**Subtopics:**

1. **Container Basics**

   * Package application + dependencies in isolated runtime.
   * Example: Modbus-to-MQTT bridge running in a Docker container on an edge gateway.

2. **Orchestration Tools**

   * Manage multiple containers using **Kubernetes**, **K3s**, or **Balena**.
   * Example: K3s cluster manages predictive maintenance services across 20 production lines.

3. **Rolling Updates and Version Control**

   * Update containers without downtime.
   * Example: Deploy new AI inference module while the old one remains active until verified.

4. **Security Considerations**

   * Sign and verify container images before deployment.
   * Use minimal base images to reduce attack surface.
