# Rules for AI Content Generation

## Course Overview
- **Course Name**: Industrial Internet-of-Things Device Developer for Automation Systems
- **Structure**: 5 modules, each with 2 days of content
- **Scope**: Electronic circuit design, microcontroller programming, and IoT development
- **Language**: English for all content

## Module Structure
- **Module 1**: Electronic Circuit and Microcontroller Design and Simulation
- **Module 2**: Advanced Microcontroller Programming and IoT Integration
- **Module 3**: Industrial Communication Protocols and Network Design
- **Module 4**: IoT Device Security and Data Management
- **Module 5**: Industrial IoT System Integration and Deployment

## Content Generation Guidelines

### Priority Order
1. **Focus on Module 1 first** - Electronic circuit design and Proteus simulation
2. Complete Module 1 before proceeding to other modules
3. Maintain consistency across all modules

### AI Content Generation Rules
- **Target Platform**: Generate prompts optimized for Gamma AI
- **Output Format**: Save generated prompts in `layout.md` file in the same folder
- **Content Structure**: Each module should include:
  - Learning objectives
  - Prerequisites
  - Day-by-day breakdown
  - Hands-on exercises
  - Assessment criteria
  - Resources and references

### Content Quality Standards
- **Technical Accuracy**: Ensure all technical content is current and accurate
- **Practical Focus**: Emphasize hands-on, project-based learning with Proteus simulation
- **Industry Relevance**: Align content with industrial automation and IoT systems
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Build complexity gradually across modules
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide step-by-step guidance for circuit design and simulation

### Language and Formatting
- **All Content**: Use English for all module descriptions, technical terms, and documentation
- **Code Examples**: Provide complete, runnable circuit designs and simulation files
- **Documentation**: Include inline comments and explanations for circuit analysis
- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform English terminology throughout

### File Management
- **Primary Output**: `layout.md` in the current module folder
- **Backup**: Keep original rules in `rules.md`
- **Version Control**: Track changes and iterations
- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform structure across all modules
