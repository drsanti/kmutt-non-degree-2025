## Table of Contents

### [Section 1: Type-Safe API Integration and Data Validation](./section1.md)

Learn how to integrate APIs with full type safety, from compile-time checks to runtime validation.

1. **TypeScript Interfaces** – Define the shape of data and ensure consistency
2. **TypeScript Generics** – Write flexible, reusable, type-safe code
3. **Runtime Validation with Zod** – Validate actual API data at runtime
4. **Combining Types with Generics and Schemas** – Full-stack type safety
5. **Handling Partial and Optional API Data** – Use utility types for incomplete data

---

### [Section 2: Advanced Type System Patterns for Scalability](./section2.md)

Master TypeScript's powerful type system to manage complexity in large projects.

1. **Discriminated Unions (Tagged Unions)** – Model multiple states safely
2. **Mapped Types** – Transform types dynamically
3. **Conditional Types** – Add logic within types
4. **Utility Types in Practice** – Leverage built-in type utilities
5. **Type Inference and Narrowing** – Understand automatic type refinement
6. **Template Literal Types** – Create string patterns with compile-time safety

---

### [Section 3: TypeScript Build and Runtime Optimization for Production](./section3.md)

Configure, compile, and deploy TypeScript for maximum reliability and performance.

1. **Strict Compiler Settings** – Enable full type safety
2. **Project References and Incremental Builds** – Speed up compilation
3. **Optimized Transpilation with Build Tools** – Use ESBuild, SWC, or Babel
4. **Type Declaration Files (.d.ts)** – Publish type-safe libraries
5. **Source Maps and Debugging in Production** – Debug minified bundles
6. **Environment-Specific Configurations** – Handle dev, staging, and prod
7. **Linting, Formatting, and Continuous Integration** – Maintain code quality
8. **Type-Driven CI/CD Deployment** – Integrate type checks in pipelines
